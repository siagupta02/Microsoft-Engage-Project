# Microsoft-Engage-Project
**Face-Recognition**
*Problem Statement:*
To mark attendance of students of a school/university using face recognition technology and keep a track of their consistency meanwhile being able to keep a list of all those who have attended the classes

*Project Description:*
This project focuses on identifying/recognising and then capturing the face of the students on a daily basis when they log into their systems or physically attend a class. The UI has been made using python.

*Project Features:*
->The attendance of employees is automatically updated in the database along with the time and date of login which will help in keeping a check on how regular an employee is and also be able to keep a track is they are low on attendance. 
->The teacher themselves can add or remove from the static database available of the students.
->Notifications/Greetings to let the students know that the class has started and they also have the option of changing the language or the pace of the greetings.

*How to run*
Install the deepface, face_recognition, numpy, open-cv, datetime, gTTS libraries using the pip install command. Run attendance.py by giving the command and save the pictures of all the students in the database itself so that the software can match for the presence of the students.
